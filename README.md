# Project Description: Bank Customer Churn Prediction Using Deep Learning
## Project Title: Bank Customer Churn Prediction Using Deep Learning

### Project Overview:
In this project, I developed a deep learning model to predict customer churn in a bank, using data sourced from Kaggle. Customer churn prediction is critical for banks to understand which customers are likely to leave, enabling them to take proactive measures to improve customer retention.

# Key Highlights:
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

* Conducted comprehensive EDA to gain insights into the data, identify trends, and understand relationships between variables.
* Utilized visualization tools like Seaborn and Matplotlib to create informative plots that highlight key patterns in the data.
## Data Preprocessing:

* Data wrangling to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data consistency.
* Feature engineering to create meaningful features from raw data.
* Data normalization and encoding categorical variables using libraries such as Pandas and NumPy.
## Deep Learning Model Development:

* Built a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras.
* Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
* Implemented techniques to prevent overfitting, such as dropout layers and early stopping.
## Model Evaluation:

* Achieved an overall accuracy of 86.5%.
* Generated a classification report, revealing that the model accurately predicted 87% of customers who did not churn and 80% of customers who did churn.
* Used metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the modelâ€™s performance.
## Technical Skills Displayed:

* Analytical Skills: Conducted thorough data analysis and visualization to extract insights.
* Problem-Solving Skills: Developed a solution to a complex business problem through deep learning.
* Data Wrangling: Cleaned and prepared the data for modeling.
* Data Preprocessing: Transformed raw data into a suitable format for machine learning.
* Deep Learning: Designed and trained a deep learning model using TensorFlow.
* Model Evaluation: Assessed model performance using advanced metrics.
## Libraries and Tools Used:

* Libraries: scikit-learn, os, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow.
* Software: Jupyter Notebook (virtual environment).
# Conclusion:
This project demonstrates my ability to apply deep learning and machine learning techniques to solve real-world business problems. By accurately predicting customer churn, the model provides valuable insights for banks to enhance their customer retention strategies. The skills and tools used in this project reflect my proficiency in data analysis, preprocessing, deep learning, and model evaluation.
